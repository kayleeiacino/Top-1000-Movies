# Top-1000-Movies
This is my first data analysis project.Â 

For this project, I analyzed a dataset of top-rated movies, focusing on the distribution of movie ratings and key trends in the film industry. I used Python and libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to clean and visualize the data. The goal was to identify patterns in how movie ratings vary across different genres, directors, and years of release.

I created a series of visualizations, including histograms and KDE plots, to highlight the distribution of ratings and examine correlations with other attributes such as meta scores and box office earnings. Through this analysis, I gained deeper insights into what makes a highly rated film successful and how audience perceptions change over time.

This project not only strengthened my data analysis skills but also gave me a better understanding of how data-driven insights can guide business and creative decisions in the entertainment industry.
